# Silencere

Did you ever have the situation of that one pesky person not stopping to ask questions at the end of a lecture, keeping everyone from having lunch?
VC classrooms have an advantage: You don't need to listen to them anymore. For those that are too socially akward to confront the person in question:
Silencere records your screen checking if the person whose voice you don't want to hear is speaking and will set your system soud to mute.
Currently works using zoom on macOS using applescript to mute. Screen area where zoom displays your name might need to be adjusted.
